# What is a xwhatsit Cap-sense USB Keyboard Controller?

It is a keyboard controller for capacitance sensing keyboards. The most common
capacitance sensing keyboards be the IBM beam-spring keyboards.

## A Little history.

In 2014 Tom Wong-Cornall published a web page titled "IBM Capsense USB keyboard 
controllers" [1]. The web page provides the technical details of the capacitance
sensing controllers.

Tom Wong-Cornall's geekhack.org ID is xwhatsit. The name of the family of
controllers comes from the original hardware creators geekhack.org ID.

Xwhatsit started a geekhack.org discussion titled "xwhatsit's Grand Unified IBM 
Capsense USB controller thread". On 11 May 2014 xwhatsit posted the details of 
the family of controllers [2].

Github user BASLQC has archived xwhatsit's original firmware source on github [3].

Xwhatsit is providing the original compiled firmware, firmware source, utility 
application binary and source. The schematics and board layouts are also provided [4]. 

In 2014 deskthority.net user Ellipse started on his odyssey to create 
reproductions of the IBM beam-spring keyboards as well. Model F Labs was created on
the journey to revive the keyboards. The history of Model F labs is on their 
"About" page [5]. 

In 2020 Deskthority forum members pandrew and tentator enabled QMK to support 
the xwhatsit controllers.

In March of 2021 Roland Huber, Deskthority.net user Darkcruix, provided an VIA 
enabled complied version of the pandrew QMK firmware for the Model F Labs
F62 and F77.

In the middle of 2021 Matthew J Wolf (github: matthew-wolf-n4mtt,
deskthority.net: wolfman) started to refactor the pandrew QMK firmware for
inclusion into the official QMK source repository.
